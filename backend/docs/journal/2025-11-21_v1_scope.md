# V1 Scope - BioRxiv Papers Only

**Date:** 2025-11-21

## V1 Target

Build a working end-to-end system using **10 clean BioRxiv preprint examples**.

### Why BioRxiv Papers?
- Nicely labeled sections (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion)
- No journal branding/watermarks
- No fancy formatting
- **No LaTeX or mathematical formulas** (skip papers with equations)
- Clean, standard structure

### V1 Pipeline Requirements

**Must work 100% reliably on these 10 papers:**

1. **Section labeling** - MUST be deterministic
   - `analysis.py` needs guaranteed section detection
   - Can't rely on bold text heuristics alone
   - Need fallback to pattern matching on text content
   - Must correctly identify: Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, References

2. **Section indexing** - 100% success rate
   - Every section must be properly indexed
   - Sentence tokenization must work reliably
   - Citation/figure links must be accurate

### Remaining Work

#### 1. Fix Section Detection (analysis.py)
- **Problem:** Bold text detection is probabilistic, fails on some PDFs
- **Solution:** Add deterministic text-based section detection
  - Search for section keywords in text regardless of formatting
  - Pattern match: "Introduction", "Methods", "Results", etc.
  - Build confidence scoring system
  - Guarantee labels for standard sections

#### 2. Build Frontend
- Display parsed papers
- Show sections clearly
- Navigate between sections
- View citations/figures

#### 3. Build Agents
- Once pipeline is reliable, add AI agents for:
  - Summarization
  - Question answering
  - Citation analysis
  - Figure interpretation

### Success Criteria

**V1 is complete when:**
- ✅ 10 BioRxiv papers parse perfectly (100% section detection)
- ✅ All sections properly labeled and indexed
- ✅ Frontend displays parsed content clearly
- ✅ Ready to add agents on top

### Out of Scope for V1

- ❌ Journal-formatted papers (Nature, Science, Cell)
- ❌ Papers with LaTeX/equations
- ❌ Papers with complex layouts
- ❌ Papers with heavy branding/watermarks
- ❌ Multi-column layout handling (keep simple)

### Next Steps

1. **TODAY:** Fix `analysis.py` to guarantee section detection
2. **NEXT:** Curate 10 clean BioRxiv papers as test set
3. **THEN:** Build frontend
4. **FINALLY:** Add agents

---

**Philosophy:** Build narrow and deep. Get 10 papers working perfectly before expanding scope.
