  - Text: Figure 1: Body map of mechanobiological disease caused in part or in whole by contractile dysfunction in cells. Three main classes of disease are represented here: connective tissue such as asthma and spastic or underactive bladder, fibrotic disease such as lung fibrosis, and oncology where tumor microenvironments, metastasis and tumor tension all play key pathological roles. There is a major need to develop therapeutics that modulate the mechanobiological function in cells to treat these classes of diseases.

  - Text: Figure 2: (a) Schematic representation of the FLECS technology: Single cells adhered to adhesive micropatterns embedded within an elastomeric film exert mechanical force onto the micropatterns resulting in their displacements. Top view demonstrates various pattern shapes, while a magnified image illustrates a contracting cell inwardly displacing its terminals. Overlay of fluorescent patterns and phase contrast images captures contracting cells, with time-lapsed images showcasing the cell's contraction over the underlying micropattern. Scale bars represent 25 μm. (b) Implementation of FLECS Technology in a 384 well-plate format. (c) Workflow for image analysis: Input includes aligned image sets of the micropatterns (set 1) and stained cell nuclei (set 2). Analysis involves (i) identification and measurement of all micropatterns in image set 1, (ii) cross-referencing the positions of each micropattern in image set 2, and (iii) determining the presence of 0, 1, or >2 nuclei (cells). Output consists of mean center-to-terminal displacements of micropatterns containing a single nucleus (one cell), compared to the median measurement of non-displaced patterns with zero nuclei. The resulting differences are presented as a horizontal histogram. MATLAB code enabling describing original versions of these algorithms are described in a previous work[16].

  - Text: Table 1. Summary of the five primary human cell types and their screening conditions. SMC cells (blue rows) and MYO cells (orange rows) differ in assay format (acute vs. 24-hour), TGF-β activation, time points, and dosing. This table highlights how each cell type was tested under distinct protocols to capture disease-relevant contractile responses. The secondary 24hr screens in SMC were performed at the primary single-point level for cursory comparison to MYO responses, but these hits were not advanced into confirmation and subsequent stages.

  - Text: Figure 3: Results from primary contraction screens across multiple cell types. The data demonstrates the platform's scalability and robustness, with clear separation between controls and hits. Expectedly, most compounds did not elicit significant responses, yet a notable subset of inhibitors was identified across cell types and doses. This underscores the non-random distribution of responses. A “Hit upper bound” threshold is marked by the green line, with non-hits below this threshold shaded in dark grey. These non-hits fail to meet normalized contraction constraints (<0.85) despite achieving robust Z-score criteria. (a) Scatter plots of acute SMC screen results. Robust Z-scores of contraction are shown, stratified by dose and cell type. Compounds are ordered by the average Z-score of contraction across all cell types and doses, with the same order maintained across all subplots. (b) Scatter plots of MYO screen results. Normalized percent change in contraction is shown, stratified by dose, timepoint, and cell type. Compounds are ordered by the average normalized percent change in contraction across all cell types, timepoints, and doses, with the same order maintained across all subplots.

  - Text: Figure 6: Screening flow-chart from primary screening to confirmation and dose response. Flowchart illustrating the screening process and the number of hits identified at each stage. A total of 2,418 compounds were screened at multiple doses in both MYO and SMC cell types, with imaging performed at biologically relevant time points. MYO cells were imaged at a single 24-hour time point to capture their response to TGF-β, which aligns with the biological timescale of myofibroblast activation. In contrast, SMCs were imaged pre-drug exposure, and at 45 minutes and 2 hours post-drug exposure to capture their acute responses. Hit definitions were established based on these time points. For comparison, SMCs were also screened at 24 hours; however, hits from this time point were not selected for further analysis as the focus remained on acute responses. Confirmation screens were subsequently conducted in triplicate using the same formats as the primary screen. Confirmed hits were defined as compounds which maintained their initial activity levels in all three of the triplicate tests.

- **Fig 10b**  (confidence: 0.80)
  - Text: Fig 10b shows that the majority of confirmed hits were active in both cell types. However, some 6 hits were not uniformly confirmed across all triplicates (e.g., not all three replicates met the criteria 7 for a hit). This reflects the data presented in the Z-score scatter plot in which some hits are active 8 but narrowly miss the hit criteria on an averaged basis. This suggests potential overall weaker 9 activity in cases where only partial confirmation was achieved. Once again, the distribution of 10 pathways represented among the confirmed hits were similar between the two cell types (Fig 11 10c), 12 From this dataset, we selected six compounds for re-testing in both cell types under the same 13 assay conditions as the original screen (i.e., 45-minute acute response to drug exposure) 14 across a 10-step, 3-fold dose range spanning low nM to double-digit µM concentrations. 15 Although the differences were less pronounced than those observed in the MYO comparison 16 (Fig 9), we still identified distinct responses between the two cell types. Specifically, compounds 17 10A–10D exhibited better potency in HBSM with similar efficacy in both cell types. Conversely, 18 compound 10F, and to a lesser extent 10E, demonstrated greater percent inhibition in HASM 19 compared to HBSM. 20 Importantly, all experiments were conducted simultaneously on the same plates, ruling out 21 batch effects or inter-experimental variability as potential causes for these differences. 22 Collectively, these findings further demonstrate that highly related cell types, such as primary 23 human bladder smooth muscle cells (HBSM) and primary human airway smooth muscle cells 24 (HASM), can exhibit distinct responses to the same compound treatments. 25

Patient-derived HASM cell lines (n =​ 12) were seeded into 8 wells each in a FLECS well-plate and a baseline image was taken. All cells were then treated with the contractile agonist bradykinin (BK; 10 µ​M final concentration) and imaged for 16 min at 4-min intervals. Half of all cells were treated with 50 µ​M formoterol and the other half were treated with DMSO vehicle. Cells were imaged for an additional 20 min at 4-min intervals and finally 10 min later. b, Distributions of responsive cells from a representative patient. The distribution shifts upwards following BK treatment and is halted by formoterol. c, Median values of the evolving contractile distributions for each of 12 patient cell lines with or without formoterol treatment.

The same set of micropatterns was then imaged for 25 min at 1-min intervals. Calcium release and contractility traces were extracted from these image series. The black triangle on the individual calcium trace denotes the addition of the agonist. F/F0 is the ratio of the fluorescent intensity (F) to the initial intensity recorded at the first time point (F0). fps, frames per second. b, All traces obtained from cells treated with bradykinin (BK) (n =​ 503 cells). c, Population-averaged traces for each agonist.

Error bars represent s.e.m. d, Correlations between peak calcium release and peak contraction for the same single cells. Histograms displayed horizontally and longitudinally correspond to the isolated contractility and calcium measurements, respectively, and the coloured bar in each distribution identifies the bin containing the median value. While each agonist induced calcium release and contraction to some extent, there were no strong correlations between these measurements.

  - Text: Figure 1. Microparticle platform for high-throughput single-cell secretion screening.(A) Individual cells are loaded into prefabricated microparticle containers (nanovials) and bound using a variety of binding schemes (i,ii). Particles and associated cells are agitated by pipetting with biocompatible oil and surfactant to generate monodisperse compartments (known as dropicles), which are dictated by the particle size preventing crosstalk between microcontainers. Cells are incubated to accumulate secretions on associated particles and transferred back to a water phase for fluorescent labeling. Particles, cells, and associated secretions are then analyzed and sorted using high-throughput commercial flow sorters. Isolated populations can then be screened downstream for different phenotypic (growth, productivity) and genotypic properties (RNA expression). (B) Photograph of a tube with 2 million dropicles formed using simple pipetting steps in less than 1 minute (left). Fluorescence microscopy image of uniform dropicles formed with fluorescently-stained nanovials and water-soluble dye (right) show distinctly sealed sub-nanoliter volumes.

(A) Area and circularity moderately correlate (R2 = 0.26) when plotting platelets of all forces (n = 540). (B) To examine the relationship of circularity and area with increasing force, platelets are split into four quartiles (n = 135 in each quartile) by force, where the lowest force quartile (quartile #1) includes platelets generating less than 14.0 nN force, quartile #2 contains platelets generating 14.0–20.6 nN force, quartile #3 contains platelets generating 20.6–29.6 nN force, and the highest force quartile (quartile #4) contains platelets generating greater than 29.6 nN force.

In addition to these individual effects, pairs of effects were tested for interactions, where a positive value in the estimate column indicates a cooperative effect and a negative value an antagonistic effect.
