Top view demonstrates various pattern shapes, while a magnified image illustrates a contracting cell inwardly displacing its terminals. Overlay of fluorescent patterns and phase contrast images captures contracting cells, with time-lapsed images showcasing the cell's contraction over the underlying micropattern. Scale bars represent 25 \u03bcm. (b) Implementation of FLECS Technology in a 384 well-plate format. (c) Workflow for image analysis: Input includes aligned image sets of the micropatterns (set 1) and stained cell nuclei (set 2). Analysis involves (i) identification and measurement of all micropatterns in image set 1, (ii) cross-referencing the positions of each micropattern in image set 2, and (iii) determining the presence of 0, 1, or >2 nuclei (cells). Output consists of mean center-to-terminal displacements of micropatterns containing a single nucleus (one cell), compared to the median measurement of non-displaced patterns with zero nuclei. The resulting differences are presented as a horizontal histogram. MATLAB code enabling describing original versions of these algorithms are described in a previous work[16].

However, some 6 hits were not uniformly confirmed across all triplicates (e.g., not all three replicates met the criteria 7 for a hit). This reflects the data presented in the Z-score scatter plot in which some hits are active 8 but narrowly miss the hit criteria on an averaged basis. This suggests potential overall weaker 9 activity in cases where only partial confirmation was achieved. Once again, the distribution of 10 pathways represented among the confirmed hits were similar between the two cell types (Fig 11 10c), 12 From this dataset, we selected six compounds for re-testing in both cell types under the same 13 assay conditions as the original screen (i.e., 45-minute acute response to drug exposure) 14 across a 10-step, 3-fold dose range spanning low nM to double-digit \u00b5M concentrations. 15 Although the differences were less pronounced than those observed in the MYO comparison 16 (Fig 9), we still identified distinct responses between the two cell types. Specifically, compounds 17 10A\u201310D exhibited better potency in HBSM with similar efficacy in both cell types. Conversely, 18 compound 10F, and to a lesser extent 10E, demonstrated greater percent inhibition in HASM 19 compared to HBSM. 20 Importantly, all experiments were conducted simultaneously on the same plates, ruling out 21 batch effects or inter-experimental variability as potential causes for these differences. 22 Collectively, these findings further demonstrate that highly related cell types, such as primary 23 human bladder smooth muscle cells (HBSM) and primary human airway smooth muscle cells 24 (HASM), can exhibit distinct responses to the same compound treatments. 25",
