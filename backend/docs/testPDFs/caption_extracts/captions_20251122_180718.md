  - Text: Fig. 1 | Operational principles of the general-use FLECS force cytometer. a, Top: technology schematic showing cells adhered to functionalized adhesive micropatterns embedded into a thin glass-supported elastomeric film. Left: top view showing multiple pattern shapes and a blow-up of a cell contracting an 'X' pattern and inwardly displacing its terminals. Middle: overlay of fluorescent patterns and phase contrast images of adhered contracting cells. Right: time-lapsed images of a contracting cell and the underlying micropattern. Scale bars, 25 μ​m. b, Well-plate implementation. c, Image analysis workflow. Input: image sets of the micropatterns (set 1) and stained cell nuclei (set 2). Processing: the algorithm (1) identifies and measures all micropatterns in image set 1, (2) cross-references the positions of each micropattern in image set 2, and (3) determines whether 0, 1 or >​2 nuclei (that is, cells) are present (see Supplementary Fig. 2). Output: mean centre-to-terminal displacements of the micropatterns containing a single nucleus (that is, one cell) are compared with the median of the corresponding measurement of all undisplaced patterns containing zero nuclei (that is, unoccupied patterns) and the differences are plotted as a horizontal histogram.

Non-contractile sub-populations were seen among the MSCs, indicating heterogeneity and potentially low purity that resulted from standard separation methods. n represents the number of cells.  A typical contracted pattern approximately representing the median case from each distribution is shown below. Scale bars, 35 µ​m. b, Overlays of fluorescent images of contracted patterns (green), phalloidin-stained actin (red) and nuclei (blue) of adipose-derived multi-potent MSCs showing three instances of cells fully spread over the patterns and actin stress fibres that route stresses to the vertices of the 'X' patterns. Scale bars, 25 μ​m.  c, Representative distributions of single-cell responses to increasing doses of blebbistatin. Plots comprise pooled data from four technical replicates of each condition. d, Dose-response curve over 3 decades in which we identify an IC50 of 2.61 µ​M. Error bars represent s.e.m. n represents number of cells in each distribution.

  - Text: Fig. 3 | Parallel study of fatal asthma and non-asthma patient-derived airway SMCs.  a, Experimental workflow. Patient-derived HASM cell lines (n =​ 12) were seeded into 8 wells each in a FLECS well-plate and a baseline image was taken. All cells were then treated with the contractile agonist bradykinin (BK; 10 µ​M final concentration) and imaged for 16 min at 4-min intervals. Half of all cells were treated with 50 µ​M formoterol and the other half were treated with DMSO vehicle. Cells were imaged for an additional 20 min at 4-min intervals and finally 10 min later. b, Distributions of responsive cells from a representative patient. The distribution shifts upwards following BK treatment and is halted by formoterol. c, Median values of the evolving contractile distributions for each of 12 patient cell lines with or without formoterol treatment. Each data point in each trace comprises an average of four separate  well measurements on the well-plate. d, Pair-wise comparison of age-, race- and gender-matched patients with and without asthma. The first age listed  is for the normal patient, while the second is for the asthmatic patient. The letters denote race and gender. The full characteristics for all patient donors  are listed in Supplementary Table 1. In general, HASM cells from asthma patients exhibited greater tone and/or contraction following stimulation.  A one-tailed Student’s t-test was performed on the patient pairs in d. *P <​ 0.05; **P <​ 0.01; ***P <​ 0.001. Error bars represent s.e.m. AA, African American; C, Caucasian; F, female; M, male.

  - Text: Fig. 4 | Collective comparisons of all asthma versus non-asthma HASM cells.  a–d, Each data point represents the median value of an individual well measurement. All wells (n =​ 96) were compared in a, only wells that received the vehicle (n =​ 48) were compared in b and c, and only wells that received formoterol (n =​ 48) were compared in d. The tone was statistically greater for asthmatic HASM cells. The initial rate of response to bradykinin (BK) was also greater for asthmatic cells. However, the long-term time response over the course of the experiment and rescue via formoterol were similar for the two groups. A one-tailed Student’s t-test was performed on pooled groups. NS, not significant.

  - Text: Fig. 5 | Simultaneous measurements of calcium release and contractility in patient-derived HASM single cells.  a, Experimental workflow. Adhered cells labelled with Fluo-8 were imaged in their tonic state. Agonists were then added and the calcium-sensitive dye intensity was recorded for 30 s at 100-ms intervals. The same set of micropatterns was then imaged for 25 min at 1-min intervals. Calcium release and contractility traces were extracted from these image series. The black triangle on the individual calcium trace denotes the addition of the agonist. F/F0 is the ratio of the fluorescent intensity (F) to the initial intensity recorded at the first time point (F0). fps, frames per second. b, All traces obtained from cells treated with bradykinin (BK) (n =​ 503 cells). c, Population-averaged traces for each agonist. Peak values from the two traces do not correlate, indicating that a high-intensity calcium signal does not necessarily translate to robust contraction. Error bars represent s.e.m. d, Correlations between peak calcium release and peak contraction for the same single cells. Histograms displayed horizontally and longitudinally correspond to the isolated contractility and calcium measurements, respectively, and the coloured bar in each distribution identifies the bin containing the median value. While each agonist induced calcium release and contraction to some extent, there were no strong correlations between these measurements.

High rates of single-cell pattern coverage are achieved. c, Phagocytic contraction of (1) ring, (2) cross and (3) filled hIgG circular patterns. The three distributions of single-cell responses were not significantly different. d, Opsonin dependence in phagocytic contraction. Vitronectin, fibrinogen, BSA and hIgG were patterned in  50 μ​m cross shapes on a stiffer, 67:1 base:crosslinker (top) and softer 71:1 (bottom) substrate. HIgG elicited the most contractile response from the largest fraction of macrophages, consistent with the role and urgency of antibody opsonization in immunity. The left y axis represents displacement, while the right y axis represents applied forces. A typical pattern representing each distribution in the 67:1 case is shown below. ***P <​0.001. In c and d, n represents the number of cells in each distribution. e, Finite element method modelling of forces exerted by a phagocytosing macrophage. Forces were modelled as boundary loads on a linear elastic material and exerted between all pairs of adjacent terminals of the cross pattern. The shape of the non-displaced pattern is outlined in white and the 5 μ​m ×​ 10 μ​m area over which force was applied is shaded. Left: complete geometry comprising a 150 μ​m ×​ 150 μ​m elastic material with 90 μ​m thickness. Middle: top view showing the direction of applied tangential forces, indicated by arrows. Right: cross-sectional view of  one-quarter of the geometry at 50% opacity, highlighting the response of the material to the boundary load and indicating the direction of net displacement. Internal columns of material are depicted only to emphasize the displaced geometry due to applied forces and do not represent real boundaries in the material. The Kruskal–Wallis test for non-parametric data was used to perform statistical analyses on the contractile distributions for the opsonin dependence experiment, with significance defined as P <​ 0.05. For the density dependence experiment, a one-way analysis of variance ruled out any significant differences. Scale bars, 25 µ​m. NS, not significant.

  - Text: Figure 1. Microparticle platform for high-throughput single-cell secretion screening.(A) Individual cells are loaded into prefabricated microparticle containers (nanovials) and bound using a variety of binding schemes (i,ii). Particles and associated cells are agitated by pipetting with biocompatible oil and surfactant to generate monodisperse compartments (known as dropicles), which are dictated by the particle size preventing crosstalk between microcontainers. Cells are incubated to accumulate secretions on associated particles and transferred back to a water phase for fluorescent labeling. Particles, cells, and associated secretions are then analyzed and sorted using high-throughput commercial flow sorters. Isolated populations can then be screened downstream for different phenotypic (growth, productivity) and genotypic properties (RNA expression). (B) Photograph of a tube with 2 million dropicles formed using simple pipetting steps in less than 1 minute (left). Fluorescence microscopy image of uniform dropicles formed with fluorescently-stained nanovials and water-soluble dye (right) show distinctly sealed sub-nanoliter volumes.

  - Text: Figure 4 –. Platelet size, shape, and structure do not strongly correlate with each other, but increase together with force. (A) Area and circularity moderately correlate (R2 = 0.26) when plotting platelets of all forces (n = 540). (B) To examine the relationship of circularity and area with increasing force, platelets are split into four quartiles (n = 135 in each quartile) by force, where the lowest force quartile (quartile #1) includes platelets generating less than 14.0 nN force, quartile #2 contains platelets generating 14.0–20.6 nN force, quartile #3 contains platelets generating 20.6–29.6 nN force, and the highest force quartile (quartile #4) contains platelets generating greater than 29.6 nN force. Contour density plots and histograms of area and circularity at each force quartile show that quartile #1 (low-force platelets) have low area and a large range of circularity, while quartile #4 (high-force platelets) tend to have both higher area and high circularity. (C) The median and median standard deviation show that circularity and area increase together with each force quartile. (D) F-actin dispersion and area do not correlate (R2 = 0.0074), (E-F) but show a similar trend when examining force quartiles. (H) F-actin dispersion and circularity moderately correlate (R2 = 0.21) and (I-J) show a shift from low-force platelets having large ranges of circularity and F-actin dispersion to high-force platelets have high circularity and high F-actin dispersion. Note that in A-F, the x-axis maximum is zoomed to better view the data. Due to this axis zoom, two points (0.37% of the data) are not shown, but all points are included within all analyses.

  - Text: Figure 5 –. K-means clustering of platelet size, shape, and structure predict differences in force. An unbiased K-means clustering approach based on platelet area, circularity, and F-actin dispersion separated the population of platelets into 2 clusters. The two clusters are shown for (A) F-actin dispersion and circularity, (B) F-actin dispersion and area, and (C) circularity and area. (D) The most representative platelet from each cluster is shown. Platelets from cluster 1 have smaller area, lower circularity, and lower F-actin dispersion than cluster 2. (E) Forces from cluster 2 are significantly higher than cluster 1, even though force was not used to determine the clusters. Beussman et al.Page 23
