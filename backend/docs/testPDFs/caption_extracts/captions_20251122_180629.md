  - Text: Figure 1: Body map of mechanobiological disease caused in part or in whole by contractile dysfunction in cells. Three main classes of disease are represented here: connective tissue such as asthma and spastic or underactive bladder, fibrotic disease such as lung fibrosis, and oncology where tumor microenvironments, metastasis and tumor tension all play key pathological roles. There is a major need to develop therapeutics that modulate the mechanobiological function in cells to treat these classes of diseases.

  - Text: Figure 2: (a) Schematic representation of the FLECS technology: Single cells adhered to adhesive micropatterns embedded within an elastomeric film exert mechanical force onto the micropatterns resulting in their displacements. Top view demonstrates various pattern shapes, while a magnified image illustrates a contracting cell inwardly displacing its terminals. Overlay of fluorescent patterns and phase contrast images captures contracting cells, with time-lapsed images showcasing the cell's contraction over the underlying micropattern. Scale bars represent 25 μm. (b) Implementation of FLECS Technology in a 384 well-plate format. (c) Workflow for image analysis: Input includes aligned image sets of the micropatterns (set 1) and stained cell nuclei (set 2). Analysis involves (i) identification and measurement of all micropatterns in image set 1, (ii) cross-referencing the positions of each micropattern in image set 2, and (iii) determining the presence of 0, 1, or >2 nuclei (cells). Output consists of mean center-to-terminal displacements of micropatterns containing a single nucleus (one cell), compared to the median measurement of non-displaced patterns with zero nuclei. The resulting differences are presented as a horizontal histogram. MATLAB code enabling describing original versions of these algorithms are described in a previous work[16].

  - Text: Table 1. Summary of the five primary human cell types and their screening conditions. SMC cells (blue rows) and MYO cells (orange rows) differ in assay format (acute vs. 24-hour), TGF-β activation, time points, and dosing. This table highlights how each cell type was tested under distinct protocols to capture disease-relevant contractile responses. The secondary 24hr screens in SMC were performed at the primary single-point level for cursory comparison to MYO responses, but these hits were not advanced into confirmation and subsequent stages.

  - Text: Figure 3: Results from primary contraction screens across multiple cell types. The data demonstrates the platform's scalability and robustness, with clear separation between controls and hits. Expectedly, most compounds did not elicit significant responses, yet a notable subset of inhibitors was identified across cell types and doses. This underscores the non-random distribution of responses. A “Hit upper bound” threshold is marked by the green line, with non-hits below this threshold shaded in dark grey. These non-hits fail to meet normalized contraction constraints (<0.85) despite achieving robust Z-score criteria. (a) Scatter plots of acute SMC screen results. Robust Z-scores of contraction are shown, stratified by dose and cell type. Compounds are ordered by the average Z-score of contraction across all cell types and doses, with the same order maintained across all subplots. (b) Scatter plots of MYO screen results. Normalized percent change in contraction is shown, stratified by dose, timepoint, and cell type. Compounds are ordered by the average normalized percent change in contraction across all cell types, timepoints, and doses, with the same order maintained across all subplots.

  - Text: Figure 6: Screening flow-chart from primary screening to confirmation and dose response. Flowchart illustrating the screening process and the number of hits identified at each stage. A total of 2,418 compounds were screened at multiple doses in both MYO and SMC cell types, with imaging performed at biologically relevant time points. MYO cells were imaged at a single 24-hour time point to capture their response to TGF-β, which aligns with the biological timescale of myofibroblast activation. In contrast, SMCs were imaged pre-drug exposure, and at 45 minutes and 2 hours post-drug exposure to capture their acute responses. Hit definitions were established based on these time points. For comparison, SMCs were also screened at 24 hours; however, hits from this time point were not selected for further analysis as the focus remained on acute responses. Confirmation screens were subsequently conducted in triplicate using the same formats as the primary screen. Confirmed hits were defined as compounds which maintained their initial activity levels in all three of the triplicate tests.

Patient-derived HASM cell lines (n =​ 12) were seeded into 8 wells each in a FLECS well-plate and a baseline image was taken. All cells were then treated with the contractile agonist bradykinin (BK; 10 µ​M final concentration) and imaged for 16 min at 4-min intervals. Half of all cells were treated with 50 µ​M formoterol and the other half were treated with DMSO vehicle. Cells were imaged for an additional 20 min at 4-min intervals and finally 10 min later. b, Distributions of responsive cells from a representative patient. The distribution shifts upwards following BK treatment and is halted by formoterol. c, Median values of the evolving contractile distributions for each of 12 patient cell lines with or without formoterol treatment. Each data point in each trace comprises an average of four separate  well measurements on the well-plate. d, Pair-wise comparison of age-, race- and gender-matched patients with and without asthma. The first age listed  is for the normal patient, while the second is for the asthmatic patient. The letters denote race and gender. The full characteristics for all patient donors  are listed in Supplementary Table 1. In general, HASM cells from asthma patients exhibited greater tone and/or contraction following stimulation.

The tone was statistically greater for asthmatic HASM cells. The initial rate of response to bradykinin (BK) was also greater for asthmatic cells. However, the long-term time response over the course of the experiment and rescue via formoterol were similar for the two groups. A one-tailed Student’s t-test was performed on pooled groups.

Adhered cells labelled with Fluo-8 were imaged in their tonic state. Agonists were then added and the calcium-sensitive dye intensity was recorded for 30 s at 100-ms intervals. The same set of micropatterns was then imaged for 25 min at 1-min intervals. Calcium release and contractility traces were extracted from these image series. The black triangle on the individual calcium trace denotes the addition of the agonist. F/F0 is the ratio of the fluorescent intensity (F) to the initial intensity recorded at the first time point (F0). fps, frames per second. b, All traces obtained from cells treated with bradykinin (BK) (n =​ 503 cells). c, Population-averaged traces for each agonist. Peak values from the two traces do not correlate, indicating that a high-intensity calcium signal does not necessarily translate to robust contraction. Error bars represent s.e.m. d, Correlations between peak calcium release and peak contraction for the same single cells. Histograms displayed horizontally and longitudinally correspond to the isolated contractility and calcium measurements, respectively, and the coloured bar in each distribution identifies the bin containing the median value. While each agonist induced calcium release and contraction to some extent, there were no strong correlations between these measurements.

In c and d, n represents the number of cells in each distribution. e, Finite element method modelling of forces exerted by a phagocytosing macrophage. Forces were modelled as boundary loads on a linear elastic material and exerted between all pairs of adjacent terminals of the cross pattern. The shape of the non-displaced pattern is outlined in white and the 5 μ​m ×​ 10 μ​m area over which force was applied is shaded. Left: complete geometry comprising a 150 μ​m ×​ 150 μ​m elastic material with 90 μ​m thickness. Middle: top view showing the direction of applied tangential forces, indicated by arrows. Right: cross-sectional view of  one-quarter of the geometry at 50% opacity, highlighting the response of the material to the boundary load and indicating the direction of net displacement. Internal columns of material are depicted only to emphasize the displaced geometry due to applied forces and do not represent real boundaries in the material. The Kruskal–Wallis test for non-parametric data was used to perform statistical analyses on the contractile distributions for the opsonin dependence experiment, with significance defined as P <​ 0.05. For the density dependence experiment, a one-way analysis of variance ruled out any significant differences. Scale bars, 25 µ​m. NS, not significant.

  - Text: Figure 1. Microparticle platform for high-throughput single-cell secretion screening.(A) Individual cells are loaded into prefabricated microparticle containers (nanovials) and bound using a variety of binding schemes (i,ii). Particles and associated cells are agitated by pipetting with biocompatible oil and surfactant to generate monodisperse compartments (known as dropicles), which are dictated by the particle size preventing crosstalk between microcontainers. Cells are incubated to accumulate secretions on associated particles and transferred back to a water phase for fluorescent labeling. Particles, cells, and associated secretions are then analyzed and sorted using high-throughput commercial flow sorters. Isolated populations can then be screened downstream for different phenotypic (growth, productivity) and genotypic properties (RNA expression).

Analysis of single-cell secretions using dropicles.(A-B) Characterization of cross-talk when performing a secretion assay with human IgG producing CHO cells with and without an encapsulation step. (A) Significant cross-talk is observed when cells and particles are left in an aqueous phase during secretion incubation. (B) Minimal cross-talk is observed when cells and associated particles are encapsulated in oil during the secretion incubation step. Thresholds in both (A) and (B) are set at 3 standard deviations above empty particle signal for the encapsulation condition. (C) Measured secretion signal increases with incubation time due to accumulation of more secreted molecules. (D) Averaged secretion measurements across the producing population shows signal increasing proportionally with time across 3 separate samples. Error bars represent standard deviation between samples. (E) A secretion assay was performed on a mixture of human IgG producing CHO cells (magenta) spiked into a non-producing CHO cell population (blue). Samples were sorted based on positive IgG signal using FACS and imaged using fluorescence microscopy to determine purity and enrichment ratio. (F) Spiked target cells were successfully isolated across a range of dilutions (1:5 – 1:1000) at purity up to 99% and nearly 1000-fold enrichment. 100,000 single cells were sorted during the enrichment study. de Rutte et al.Page 29

(A) Area and circularity moderately correlate (R2 = 0.26) when plotting platelets of all forces (n = 540). (B) To examine the relationship of circularity and area with increasing force, platelets are split into four quartiles (n = 135 in each quartile) by force, where the lowest force quartile (quartile #1) includes platelets generating less than 14.0 nN force, quartile #2 contains platelets generating 14.0–20.6 nN force, quartile #3 contains platelets generating 20.6–29.6 nN force, and the highest force quartile (quartile #4) contains platelets generating greater than 29.6 nN force. Contour density plots and histograms of area and circularity at each force quartile show that quartile #1 (low-force platelets) have low area and a large range of circularity, while quartile #4 (high-force platelets) tend to have both higher area and high circularity. (C) The median and median standard deviation show that circularity and area increase together with each force quartile.
