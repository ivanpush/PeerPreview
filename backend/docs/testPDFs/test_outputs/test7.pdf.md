### **Abstract**


Bovine mastitis is a recurring disease among herds that is often caused by unhygienic


farm conditions, resulting in bacterial invasion of the udder. It is a leading cause of


financial losses for dairy farmers, largely due to the widespread use of antimicrobials for


treatment, which in turn fuels the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Somatic cell


count (SCC) is a widely used quantitative method for diagnosing sub-clinical and clinical


mastitis. We have developed a rapid and quantitative microfluidic device that enables the


quantification of somatic cells in milk, thereby aiding in the diagnosis of bovine mastitis.


Our platform features a microfluidic cartridge for capturing somatic cells, which is inserted


into an in-house device called the mCytoCounter. The device reads the fluorescence


emission signals from the somatic cells captured on the membrane in 2 minutes, with a


total turnaround time of 15 minutes. The mCytoCounter is an automated and deployable


system that can be used in dairy farms with minimal training. We analysed the


performance of mCytoCounter with milk samples and benchmarked it against the SCC


using a fluorescence microscope with a correlation coefficient of 0.97. The mCytoCounter


has a detection range of 10 [3] to 10 [6] SCC/mL, which covers the required cell number range


to discriminate between healthy, subclinical, and clinical mastitis.


Bovine Mastitis is the most common disease among lactating dairy animals, resulting in


low production and inferior-quality milk. Mastitis is mainly caused by a bacterial invasion,


resulting in the influx of leukocytes, accompanied by inflammation of the udder, and


results in an increase in the SCC in the produced milk. Hence, SCC in milk is an indicator


of bovine health and is an early biomarker for subclinical and clinical mastitis. Globally,


there are an estimated 270 million dairy cows (WWF, 2022). India is the world’s largest


milk producer, with a population of 57 million dairy cows, which produced 239.30 million


metric tonnes of milk in the fiscal year 2023-2024 (1). The economic loss due to mastitis


every year is tremendously high. Uttar Pradesh alone in India suffers a yearly loss of


157.51 million USD due to subclinical and clinical mastitis (2). In India, the economic


losses from mastitis have increased by about 115-fold in the last five decades and cost


about 860 million USD annually (3).


Mastitis is majorly a result of intramammary infection, defined as the presence of a


pathogen in the mammary gland resulting in milk contamination, making it unfit for


consumption(4). Somatic cells are a mixture of milk-secreting epithelial cells and white


blood cells (WBCs) (80%) that enter the mammary gland(5). Typically, <200,000 SCC/mL


is considered uninfected, 300,000 to 500,000 SCC/mL is subclinical mastitis, and


>500,000 SCC/mL (6). In clinical mastitis cases, the SCC can go up to >1X10 [6 ] cells/mL


(7). Clinical mastitis is inferred from the presence of visibly abnormal milk and inflamed


udder and is mostly evaluated by SCC, fever and inflammation of the udder (5).


Subclinical mastitis is interpreted by the presence of inflammation but visibly normal milk


and mammary glands. Due to no visible depletion in the milk quality, it often goes


unnoticed, as farmers can’t detect it without tests like SCC. This makes it a bigger problem


as it can silently spread in the herds before being detected, resulting in a cumulative effect


on the yield and herd health (8). Some common tests evaluated for diagnosis of


subclinical mastitis are SCC, lactose percentage, measurement of lactate dehydrogenase


activity, and electrical conductivity (5,9,10).


Majority of bovine mastitis is caused by _Staphylococcus aureus_ and it spreads easily in


the herd if left untreated (Patel et al., 2021). The reported prevalence of _S. aureus-induced_


mastitis, however, varies considerably depending on the form of the disease and


geographical location. A comprehensive review noted that _S. aureus_ can account for


_Klebsiella_ are responsible for causing sub-clinical and clinical mastitis in India (14) (15).


High numbers of antibiotic resistance rates of these bovine mastitis-causing pathogens,


including many multidrug-resistant isolates, have been reported in various countries in


recent years (16–19). These antimicrobial-resistant strains can be transferred to other


cows, buffaloes in the herd and humans through milk and meat. High levels of _S. aureus_


resistance to most antibiotics, such as penicillin, erythromycin, tetracycline, gentamicin,


tobramycin, kanamycin, and methicillin (MRSA), making it especially difficult to contain.


Due to economic pressure, antibiotic consumption is high, leading to the selection of AMR


strains (20). The early detection of mastitis can reduce the incidence of severe cases of


intramammary infection and, consequently, reduce antimicrobial usage. The need for a


rapid and economical test that can help dairy farmers diagnose bovine mastitis at an early


stage is increasingly recognized.


Some widely used methods for estimating somatic cells in milk are- direct SCC, California


mastitis test (CMT), Wisconsin mastitis test (WMT), and esterase activity test. There are


numerous automated somatic cell counters that utilise microscopy for cell counting (21).


Most of them use fluorescent dye or a stain to label the cells and visualize them under a


microscope, followed by manual or automated counting. There are reference methods for


cell counting, such as flow cytometry (22). However, these tests are only available at dairy


veterinary clinics, reducing their utility as an on-farm diagnostic tool. Also, these counting


methods are either expensive, time-consuming, or require manual intervention.


Quantitative fluorescence assays can help eliminate the manual counting steps, saving


time per reaction. CMT, WMT, and esterase activity tests are either qualitative or semi

quantitative on-farm (cow-side) tests used to estimate SCC in milk (23).


Microfluidics has emerged as a powerful tool in various applications, ranging from basic


biological research to clinical research and development (24). Microfluidics is a system


that enables the processing and manipulation of small volumes of liquids in channels with


dimensions in micrometres. It has many advantages, such as the ability to use a small


heterogeneous cell population has many applications, especially in biomedical and


biochemical research (26).


A vast array of active and passive methods has been employed to separate blood cells.


Active methods constitute technologies that operate based on an external field or a force,


while passive methods use the physicochemical properties of the cells (27). Micropillar


structures, microporous membranes, etc., can separate cells and beads based on their


size and compressibility, which can be exploited to separate WBCs from erythrocytes or


plasma from the rest of the cells. Although many have reported that these types of


separations may result in clogging, that can be overcome using proper dilutions (Miao Ji


excellent specificity and high-throughput screening with substantial data outputs.


However, they are not widely used in clinical settings due to the following factors: higher


instrument cost, intensive training of the user personnel, higher initial and operating costs

SCC and shown its utility for farm deployment.
### **Materials and Methods**


The entire assay is performed in a 3D-printed microfluidic cartridge and device with a


temperature controller, fluorescence reader and control electronics. The device can


evaluate two cartridges simultaneously. Each cartridge has four channels and can be


used to read four different milk samples.

**2.1 Cartridge and Device Fabrication**


The cartridge was 3D printed with a ProJet MJP 2500 [3D Systems] using VisiJet MJP


2500-CL and WH (white, translucent material). It has dimensions of 70 x 40 x 5mm (L x


B x H). The cartridge has four sample wells that can accommodate 50µL of the sample.

The optical system is a customized setup consisting of an LED, lenses, excitation and


emission filters, and a dichroic mirror. A spherical lens with a focal length of 12mm is


combined with an LED and a filter with an excitation wavelength of 480 nm and an


emission wavelength of 510 nm (long pass). The detector is a photodiode integrated with


in-house software to calculate fluorescence signal in the form of Relative Fluorescence


Units (RFU). The values obtained can be compared with the calibration graph to get the


approximate cell count. The fluorescence reader is mounted on a linear guide allowing


independent reading of fluorescent signals from two different cartridges and eight wells.


The process flow of the mCytoCounter is shown in Figure 2B. The electronic assembly


ensures a fully automatic data acquisition and GUI. Supplementary figure_S2 shows the


block diagram of the printed circuit board. The hardware has been designed in a modular


fashion where the microcontroller, an integrated circuit interacts with the GUI via


touchscreen pad and initiates the program.


The somatic cells were isolated from whole cow milk using centrifugation (Supplementary


Figure_S1). Briefly, the milk (40 mL) was collected in a falcon tube and centrifuged at


1800g for 30 minutes. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was washed two


times with 1X PBS [Sigma, P4417-100TAB] at 1500g for 10 minutes. The final pellet was


then resuspended in 1mL PBS. The isolated somatic cells were counted using a


hemocytometer [Rohem, India]. For ease of counting, the cells were labeled with


methylene blue in a ratio of 0.1:4 (Methylene blue: Cells). The known number of somatic


cells was then used to prepare the calibration curve with different dilutions. The dilutions


were prepared in depleted milk (Milk without cells; removed by centrifugation) to mimic


the actual conditions. The plot was made using _OriginPro_ 2020b, data analysis, and


Whole milk samples were diluted five times with 1X Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS)


(1:5) [Sigma, P4417-100TAB] and labeled with the CFDA, SE (5-(and-6)

CarboxyfluoresceinDiacetateSuccinimidylEster)alsocalledCFSEdye[ThermoFisher


C1157] for 10 minutes at 37 [o] C to fluorescently label the somatic cells. About 80µL of the


sample is added into the cartridge with the help of a pipette into the sample input channel.


The sample is moved to the filter by a vacuum pump installed in the m-CytoCounter. The


filter captures the somatic cells and lets the remaining liquid pass to the dump. The filter


is a glass microfiber-B (GF/B) with a pore size of 1µm, laser-cut to a diameter of 5mm to


fit into the cartridge. The captured cells on the filter are then excited, and the emission


signal is read by an in-house fluorescent reader installed in the device. The entire assay,


from sample preparation and addition into the cartridge to the fluorescence readout, takes


about 15 minutes (Figure 1C). The plot was created using OriginPro 2020b, a data


analysis and graphing software.


The somatic cell capture and labeling were evaluated with five different filter membranes


and four labeling dyes, respectively. This was done to optimize the cell retention in the


cartridge with uniform labeling of the cells thereby ensuring better reproducibility of the


assay.


Five different filter membranes were evaluated for the performance with somatic cell


capture (Figure 3A). Glass Fibre- B, F, D, CP and polycarbonate track-etched membrane


(PCTE) were used [GF/F, GF/D, GF/CP, and PCTE were purchased from GE Healthcare


Life Sciences Whatman [TM] 1825-047, GE Healthcare Life Sciences Whatman [TM] 1823-047,


Sigma GFCP001000, Cytiva Whatman [TM] 10418306, respectively]. The blank membranes


and membranes with captured cells were evaluated under an inverted fluorescence


microscope (Olympus IX71). The somatic cells were labeled with CFSE dye (90 µM). The


excitation and emission wavelengths for CFSE dye are 492nm/517nm. The Glass Fibre


B (GF/B) performed the best out of all the membranes. It has a pore size of 1µm, which


captures the maximum number of somatic cells without clogging due to its high porosity.


Other glass fibre membranes had a higher background in blank membranes. Although


the polycarbonate track-etched membrane also yielded comparable results, it has a low


porosity (10%), leading to clogging and uneven cell capture (32).


The somatic cells were labeled using 4 different dyes- acridine orange, CFSE (5-(and-6)

Carboxyfluorescein Diacetate, Succinimidyl Ester), Eva green and FDA (fluorescein


diacetate). The results obtained are shown in Figure 3B. Acridine orange was added to


the somatic cell sample, spiked in milk and visualized under the microscope after 5


minutes. It is a cell-permeable nucleic acid binding dye, but resulted in higher background


fluorescence signals as compared to other dyes. A lot of non-specific binding with fats

dye and was used with Triton X-100 detergent. It was inefficient in binding to all the


somatic cells, as the permeability due to the detergent was not uniform. Different

fluorescence microscope (Supplementary Figure_S3). A calibration plot was developed


using the known concentration of cells. The cell concentration was determined in a


hemocytometer and was serially diluted in four dilutions ranging from 10 [7] to 10 [4 ] cells/mL.


The dilutions were not made beyond 10 [4] cells/mL as it was difficult to spot cells in these


diluted samples. The sample was added in a flow cell with dimensions 1cm X 1.8cm X


0.003cm (l*b*h). The average number of cells was calculated by counting the cells in 20


different frames using a 10x objective in a fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX71). The


experiment was repeated thrice, and the average number of cells was then used to


prepare a calibration plot (Figure 5A). The average cell count per field of view followed a


linear fit over a four-log dynamic range. At lower concentrations, such as lower than 10000


cells/mL (~1 to 2 cells/ frame), it becomes laborious to count cells and has a higher


variation probability; hence, quantification from mCytoCounter would be helpful


Somatic cells isolated from milk have a heterogeneous population of cells consisting of


epithelial cells and leukocytes(4,7,22). These cells differ in size, shape, and deformability.


Epithelial cell diameter, for instance, ranges from 1-15µm(33,34).


The somatic cells were isolated from 80mL milk as explained in Supplementary


Figure_S1. The isolated somatic cells were then counted using a hemocytometer and


serially diluted in the diluted (1:5) depleted milk from 10 [6] to 10 [3] cells/mL. The calibration


plot was produced using somatic cells spiked in diluted milk (1:5). The milk used for


preparing dilutions was depleted (obtained after one round of centrifugation 1800g for 30


minutes) to remove fats and cells. The fluorescence was measured using a plate reader


and an in-house mastitis diagnosis device (mCytoCounter) and recorded as Relative


Fluorescence Units (RFU). The calibration plot for somatic cells spiked into the depleted


milk has been displayed in Figure 5, where the serially diluted input sample was measured


for fluorescence using the plate reader. For fluorescence measurement in the plate


reader, the GF-B membrane in the cartridge were removed and checked directly in the


The performance of mCytoCounter was evaluated using three different techniques.


Firstly, the GF/B membrane was evaluated for its capture and fluorescence performance


in a commercial plate reader for which the somatic cells were captured on the membrane


in a column using centrifugation. Secondly, the cartridge was evaluated for its cell capture


efficiency, and fluorescence was recorded in the commercial plate reader. Finally, the


somatic cells were captured on the membrane in the cartridge and fluorescence was


recorded in the mCytoCounter.


**3.4.1 Filtration using centrifuge and reading in the plate reader-**


The GF/B membrane was initially evaluated in the Qiagen QIAprep spin miniprep column


(removed the Qiagen membrane and placed GF/B) for its ability to capture somatic cells.


The membrane was carefully placed inside the column and fixed with O-rings. Somatic


cells were diluted from 10 [3] to 10 [6] cells/mL in depleted milk. The labeled somatic cells


sample was added from the top, and the columns were centrifuged at 300g for 10 minutes.


The membrane was then removed from the column, and the emission signals were read


using a multimode plate reader (PerkinElmer, Victor Nivo). The experiment was repeated


five times and plotted as shown in Figure 5B. This experiment was conducted to verify


that the GF/B membrane could efficiently capture somatic cells and that these cells could


be detected for emission signals using a commercial plate reader.


**3.4.2 Filtration in the cartridge and reading in the plate reader**


After evaluating the GF/B membrane in the column, the somatic cells were captured in


the cartridge. The serially diluted somatic cells were externally labelled with CFSE and


added to the cartridge. The liquid operations were performed manually using a syringe.


As the sample moved in the cartridge, the somatic cells got captured in the cartridge and


the remaining liquid moved to the dump. The membranes were removed from the


cartridge and read in a multimode plate reader (PerkinElmer, Victor Nivo). This confirmed


that the cartridge could capture the somatic cells, as no cells were observed in the dump


liquid when observed under the microscope. The experiment was repeated five times and


plotted as shown in Figure 5C. The coefficient of determination (R [2] ) was 0.99, indicating


Figure 5- Calibration curves. **A** - Calibration curve from microscope. The experiment was repeated 4 times. **B** - Results in the column. The experiment was repeated 5 times. **C** Results in the cartridge. The experiment was repeated 5 times. The somatic cells were isolated and spiked in the depleted milk (1:5). Error bars represent standard deviation


After assessing the membrane and cartridge, the somatic cells were captured in the


cartridge and quantified using the mCytoCounter device. The serially diluted somatic cells


were externally labeled with CFSE dye and added in the cartridge. Each sample well was


loaded with a different dilution of somatic cells. The cartridge was inserted into the device


for the device to move the sample through the membrane to the dump. After that, it began


reading all the membranes one by one and produced the results in the form of relative


fluorescence units. The experiment was performed three times, and the readings were


then used to plot a calibration curve, as shown in Figure 6A. The mCytoCounter has a


detection range of 10 [3] to 10 [6] SCC/mL, which covers the required cell number range to


discriminate between healthy, subclinical, and clinical mastitis.


**3.5.  Benchmarking SCC in mCytoCounter and microscope with farm samples-**


About 20 fresh milk samples were procured from a dairy farm in New Delhi. The somatic


cells were quantified both in the mCytoCounter and the microscope. The milk was diluted


(1:5) with 1X PBS and labeled using CFSE dye (90 µM). After labeling, samples were


added to the cartridge, and the readings were recorded in the mCytoCounter. The same


sample was then added to a flow cell (1cm X 2.8 cm) with a height of 30 µm and visualized


in the microscope with a blue filter cube (excitation range 460-495 nm, emission range


510-800nm). The images were captured (20 frames) and cells were counted manually.


The RFU value from mCytoCounter and the manual count from the microscope (cells/


frame) were recorded. The calibration plot, generated using the mCytoCounter and the


microscope, was used to calculate the exact cell count. The results were plotted and


compared in the correlation plot as shown in Figure 6B.

that use fluorescence microscopy to count the somatic cells (Table 1). The device


requires preprocessing, mixing milk with the nucleic acid labeling dye Sofia green.


Sceptor2.0, are also very expensive. Sceptor2.0 is a handheld device and requires 6 spin


wash cycles of 2 minutes each to remove fats and other interfering substances in the milk.

Table 1- Comparison between commercial somatic cell counters


A quantitative test for diagnosing bovine mastitis has been developed utilizing the


fluorescence principle to count somatic cells in milk. The microfluidic cartridge can


separate the somatic cells from milk, which are then quantified using a fluorescence


detector in the mCytoCounter. The somatic cell quantification results obtained from the


mCytoCounter were compared with the count obtained from the fluorescence


microscope. The correlation coefficient was 0.97, showing that the mCytoCounter is a


rapid and accurate diagnostic method for bovine mastitis. The mCytoCounter has a


detection range of 10 [3] SCC/mL to 10 [6] SCC/mL which covers the required cell number


range to discriminate between healthy, subclinical mastitis and clinical mastitis.


Regardless, future work would evaluate the system with a higher sample size.


Although our present work demonstrates the applicability of mCytoCounter as a


diagnostic solution for bovine mastitis, it has the potential to be utilized across a diverse


range of samples, such as blood and urine, with slight modifications in the mechanical


and electronic designs. The current version of the device demonstrated satisfactory


performance under controlled conditions. However, further modifications are underway to


enhance its usability and adaptability for on-field applications by farmers.
