The PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors enriched in the HHSteC-specific cluster, for example, have well-documented effects on cell survival and metabolism that could indirectly reduce contractility without revealing targetable disease mechanisms.",

The number of clusters was determined by 'visual inspection' without quantitative validation.
